I spend a lot of time thinking about technology, business, strategy and the intersection between them. More specifically I&amp;rsquo;m interested in how strategic choices influence technology and to some extent how technological choices once made become constraints for strategy. I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate enough to have people around me who are also interested in some of these things and we have fun conversing about these things. A bunch of the ideas that I write about would either have originated from those conversations or would have been in some shape or form influenced by them.</description></item></channel></rss>
