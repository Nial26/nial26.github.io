Most of this adoption can be attributed to one phenomenon, crypto.
Decentralization is as the name suggests refers to systems without a center. This is in contrast to a centralized system where the center is the source of truth, control, dispute resolution, etc. all of which still need to be solved in a decentralized system but are done so without a center.</description></item><item><title>Qualities and Business Models</title><link>https://aditya.rs/2022/02/08/qualities-and-business-models/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2022 13:20:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://aditya.rs/2022/02/08/qualities-and-business-models/</guid><description>At an abstract level, people generally use tools and technologies primarily for three reasons, to make money, to save money, or to save time. All technologies have to provide at least one (ideally all three) of these benefits to their users for the overhead of using them. This is true for all tools and technologies from the primitive tools used to create fire to modern computers used to solve all kinds of problems.</description></item><item><title>Connecting People</title><link>https://aditya.rs/2022/01/24/connecting-people/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 16:58:49 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://aditya.rs/2022/01/24/connecting-people/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;A buddy of mine&amp;rdquo; has been building a dating app, so Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about services which connect people.

I spend a lot of time thinking about technology, business, strategy and the intersection between them. More specifically I&amp;rsquo;m interested in how strategic choices influence technology and to some extent how technological choices once made become constraints for strategy. I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate enough to have people around me who are also interested in some of these things and we have fun conversing about these things. A bunch of the ideas that I write about would either have originated from those conversations or would have been in some shape or form influenced by them.</description></item></channel></rss>
